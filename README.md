# RecSys 2015 


## Introduction 
This repository is my experiment on RecSys 2015 (https://recsys.acm.org/recsys15/challenge/)

YOOCHOOSE is providing a collection of sequences of click events; click sessions. For some of the sessions, there are also buying events. The goal is hence to predict whether the user (a session) is going to buy something or not, and if he is buying, what would be the items he is going to buy.
